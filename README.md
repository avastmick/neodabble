# neodabble

This project has a set of tools and documentation to get a developer up and running quickly and repeatably.

It includes:

- [Instructions and scripts to set up a local private testnet](docs/Local-Private-Network.md)
- [Instructions and scripts to set up a local node](docs/Local-Node.md)
- *TODO:* [Instructions and scripts to create contracts](contracts/README.md)
    + Includes example contracts

It eventually will have a run once script to install a fresh build on a developer machine:

- First will be Linux (Ubuntu)
- Second will be Windows (10)
- *Last will be Mac*
